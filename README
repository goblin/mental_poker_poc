This is a simple proof of concept to implement mental poker for two players
(texas hold'em) using libTMCG. IT WILL WORK!

It requires libTMCG from http://www.nongnu.org/libtmcg/

To compile, type make (or gmake) - make sure libTMCG-config is in your path.

To test run, use:

  $ mkfifo fi fo

then in one terminal run:

  $ ./master > fi < fo

and in another run:

  $ ./slave < fi > fo

If it feels too slow for you, edit both .cc files and change the security
parameter t from 64 to something lower (e.g. 48) - read libTMCG's docs for
more info.

But it works! We can easily implement 2-player texas hold'em without a central
server or trusted authority!
